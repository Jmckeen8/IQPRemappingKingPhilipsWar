Marlborough was established in an area that placed them side-by-side (if not on top) of the Okkokonimesit Praying Indian plantation. The treaty that was negotiated with the Praying Indians, with the assistance of John Eliot, gave the colonists of the Marlborough Plantation first rights to any land given up by the Indians, perhaps providing incentive for the colonists to try to force the Indians off their plantation.",
					"wartime": "On August 30-31, 1675, Marlborough was the site of an incident between the notoriously brutal Captain Samuel Mosely and local Indians. Mosely falsely accused Praying Indians that had been captured by the Nipmucs for the attack on Lancaster on August 22nd.<br>In March of 1676, Praying Indians that had been recruited to be guides for the colonial army and who had been captured by the Nipmucs, including Tukapewillin--a minister from Hassanemesit, were harrased and abused by colonists in Marlborough while trying to escape captivity back to their colonial allies.<br>On March 26, 1676, Marlborough was attacked by Nipmuc Indians in the morning during a church service (it was a Sabbath day). About a third of the homes in Marlborough were destroyed as well as the meeting house. A counterattack later in the day from the colonists did result in the wounding of about thirty Indians, fourteen of whom died.",
					"postwar": "Most of the townspeople abandoned their homes in Marlborough after the attack on March 26, 1676, moving in closer towards Boston. However, some of the garrison houses were maintained throughout the rest of the war. After the war, a rebuilding effort did begin, with land from the Okkokonimesit Praying Indian plantation being sold to the colonists."
