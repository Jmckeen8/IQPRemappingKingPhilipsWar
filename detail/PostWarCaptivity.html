<h3>Bridgetown</h3>
<p>Bridgetown was the capital and main trading hub of colonial Barbados. Thus it was a prominent slave port in the Caribbean island regions throughout and after King Philip's War. Although no captured indigenous person wanted to be enslaved and shipped abroad, Barbados was especially feared as a destination for newly captured slaves. The Caribbean islands were notorious for the particularly brutal and abusive treatment of slaves that occurred there under colonist rule, and Barbados had the worst reputation of the islands in this regard.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Barbadian slavers often feared the use of overseas indigenous captives in the area as much as those captives feared working under the Barbadian slavers. The May 1675 discovery of a plot by African slaves to eliminate all the white people on the island left the slavers terrified at the prospect of any slave revolts. Even though the revolt was organized by Africans, horror stories from King Philip's War propaganda about alleged indigenous deceit and cruelty had long made the rounds amongst Barbados's colonist population. They stood in stark contrast to the propaganda about African enslavement, which characterized the Africans as simpleminded and in need of paternalistic guidance. So, the slavers reasoned, if African slaves could form a plot against them, imagine the plans indigenous slaves could make.</p>

<h3>Roebuck Street</h3>
<p>Although Barbados colonists had tried to establish state houses since the colony's foundation, it was not until the 19th century that any specific building caught on as the official house of Parliament. As a result, Parliament instead met to discuss legislature at watering holes and inns throughout Bridgetown. Roebuck Inn, the place for which this street was named, was amongst the most popular locations for Parliamentary meetings and conferences in the 17th century. Hence, any legislation regarding slavery on the island during that time period was probably announced on this street or in an area like it.</p>
<p>In 1675, as a reaction to a then-recently caught slave revolt, Parliament announced the passage of "An Act of Explanation to the Act of Negroes, and to prohibited the bringing of Indians to this Island." This bill, amongst other rules clamping down on whites' permitted interactions with slaves, imposed criminal charges and steep penalties on anybody who would import indigenous slaves from the New England colonies. It also stipulated that all indigenous slaves from the New England colonies had to be shipped back to where they came from. The only exceptions were for the slavers who bought indigenous slaves before the passage of the law. They could instead pay a fee of 10,000 pounds (roughly 4,536 kilograms in today's metric system) of muscovado sugar per kept slave. Although this bill would inspire similar legislation in Jamaica and Antigua, it only served to slow the influx of indigenous slaves imported from New England. Thus, the threat of being sold into Caribbean slavery continued to loom over the indigenous combatants of King Philip's War.</p>
